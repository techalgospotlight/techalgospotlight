Array rotation is a fundamental operation often encountered in programming, particularly in algorithms and data manipulation tasks. It involves shifting the elements of an array by a specified number of positions, either to the left or the right. This operation can be essential for various applications, such as data visualization, game development, or implementing certain algorithms. In this article, we’ll explore an efficient way to perform right rotations on an array in JavaScript, with a practical example and detailed explanation.

Problem Statement
-----------------

Given an integer array **A** of size **N** and an integer **B**, the task is to return the same array after rotating it **B** times towards the right. Let’s break down the problem with an example:

### Example

```txt
Input:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
B = 2
```


### Explanation

Rotating the array **[1, 2, 3, 4]** to the right by 2 positions results in **[3, 4, 1, 2]**.

### Approach

To solve this problem efficiently, consider the following:

*   **Modulo Operation**: Since rotating an array of size N by N times returns the array to its original state, rotating by B times can be simplified using B % N. This reduces unnecessary rotations and speeds up the process.
*   **New Index Calculation**: For each element in the original array, calculate its new index in the rotated array. This can be done using the formula: **(current_index + B) % N**, where N is the length of the array.
*   **Auxiliary Array**: Create an auxiliary array to store the rotated elements, which helps in avoiding in-place modifications and simplifies index calculations.

JavaScript Implementation
-------------------------

Let’s implement this approach in JavaScript:

```js
function rotateArray(A, B) {
    const N = A.length;
    // Handle cases where B is greater than N
    B = B % N; 
    const result = new Array(N).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        result[(i + B) % N] = A[i];
    }
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
const A = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const B = 2;
console.log(rotateArray(A, B)); // Output: [3, 4, 1, 2]
```


### Explanation

*   **Handling Large B**: The modulo operation (B = B % N) ensures that we don’t perform unnecessary rotations. For instance, rotating an array of size 4 by 6 times is the same as rotating it 2 times (6 % 4 = 2).
*   **Result Array**: We create a new array result to store the rotated values. For each element at index i in the original array, we place it at index (i + B) % N in the result array. This formula wraps around the array boundaries, ensuring the rotation is seamless.
*   **Efficiency**: This approach operates in O(N) time complexity and requires O(N) additional space for the result array, making it efficient for large arrays.

Conclusion
----------

Array rotation is a simple yet powerful operation that can be efficiently implemented using basic arithmetic and array manipulation techniques. By understanding the underlying principles, such as the modulo operation and index calculation, you can handle large rotations and optimize your code. Whether you’re working on algorithms, data structures, or real-world applications, mastering array rotation will enhance your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of array operations in JavaScript.
