As we know, **Operators** are **Key Pillars** of every programming language, Instead of talking about other things, Letâ€™s talk about only **Rust Operators the four pillars of empire**. Sounds weird? I know because you are in **TechAlgoSpotlight**. We only do weird things ðŸ˜…

Basically, operators are nothing. They used to do various types of **operations in values or maybe variables**. So, Rust also came with this type of common functionality in four parts. **Arithmetic Operators, Logical Operators, Comparison Operators and Compound Assignment Operators**.

Are you ready to see each of them? Letâ€™s get started with wasting a lot of time. ðŸ˜‰

!Rust Operators Okay TechAlgoSpotlight

* * *

1\. Rust with Arithmetic Operators
----------------------------------

As we know everywhere arithmetic operators are only used for **addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Rust did the same things without any fear.**

Letâ€™s think about two variables, the First **X** and the Second **Y**. Let me show you something in table form. I know, you know these things, But as a responsible admin, I have to show you, How many types of arithmetic operators are available in Rust.


|Operators         |Using What We Can Do|
|------------------|--------------------|
|+ (Addition)      |X + Y               |
|- (Subtraction)   |X â€“ Y               |
|* (Multiplication)|X * Y               |
|/ (Division)      |X / Y               |
|% (Remainder)     |X % Y               |


### Rust with Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication Operators

We will see the Division operator after some time. **The longer you wait, The more you get**. ðŸ˜‚

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = 18;
    let b = 2;

    // add two variables using + operator
    let x = a + b;
    println!("{} + {} = {}", a, b, x);

    // subtract two variables using - operator
    let y = a - b;
    println!("{} - {} = {}", a, b, y);

    // multiply two variables using * operator
    let z = a * b;
    println!("{} * {} = {}", a, b, z);
}
```


#### Output (Result)

```rs
18 + 2 = 20
18 - 2 = 16
18 * 2 = 36
```


Have seen magic? Rust just did with giving us the output. Letâ€™s see some more magical things with Division Operators.

* * *

### Rust with Division Operator

```rs
fn main() {
    let dividend = 21;
    let divisor = 8;

    // arithmetic division using / operator with integers
    let division = dividend / divisor;

    println!("{} / {} = {}", dividend, divisor, division);
}
```


#### Output

As per the code, you can understand. We did just a simple division with **/** Operators. But wait here is the twist come.

Regular calculation gives us **2.625**. But in Rust, When we use division operators for operation. Instead of a floating value, they give us an **Int value** (2). I donâ€™t know why Rust acts like this But maybe internally they like JavaSciprt.

Anyway, What if we want float values with a division operator? So, silently Rust introduced a trick to achieve floating values by passing **floating integers**.

> **Spotlight**: Floating Integer is like x = 2 works as an integer but x = 2.0 works as an floating integer.

Letâ€™s take a small example while closing our eyes.

```rs
fn main() {
    let dividend = 21.0;
    let divisor = 8.0;

    // arithmetic division using / operator with floating point values
    let division = dividend / divisor;

    println!("{} / {} = {}", dividend, divisor, division);
}
```


As we discussed in Spotlight. **Floating Integer is nothing but a copycat of Float**.

#### Output

By assigning **dividend** and **divisor** as a float value. We got a float value, Simple. Now, we have to learn the **remainder**. So letâ€™s see how **remainder operators** work.

* * *

### Rust with Remainder Operator

```rs
fn main() {
    let dividend = 21;
    let divisor = 8;

    // arithmetic remainder using % operator
    let remainder = dividend % divisor;
  
    println!("{} % {} = {}", dividend, divisor, remainder);
}
```


#### Output:

As we donâ€™t know the remainder, So, letâ€™s understand the code first. Instead of using other arithmetic operators, They used **%**. It works like the operator name. **Just give us reminders**. Nothing Else. Finish!!!

I donâ€™t think so any other arithmetic operators remaining. ðŸ¤” **Letâ€™s see Assignment Operators with a cup of tea.**

* * *

2\. Rust with Assignment Operator
---------------------------------

**Assignment operator used for assigning values. Thatâ€™s it!!!** ðŸ¤£

Here we are using **=** for assigning 007 to bobbyDeol. Maybe in the future bobbyDeol become 007. But as syntax vice, itâ€™s 007. Assignment operators are like I am giving you something, Hold it until you die.ðŸ˜‚

Do you have questions like, What if we have to change the value of a variable? Letâ€™s see how we can do by putting the small keyword **mut** (Mutable).

As we discussed bobbyDeol example of assigning 007. Sowe can not change. But after using **mut** keyword, We can change bobbyDeol to 700.

Now **mut** keyword is introduced and I would like to tell you more about this. let me share one example with you.

* * *

### Rust Compound Assignment Operators

The simplest definition of this operator is we can do some operations with shorter syntax. Let me show you How we can do in Rust.

```rs
let mut x = 1;

// compound assignment operators
x += 3;
```


#### Output

Rust has some fancy terms. Looks like, they use almost JavaScript Syntax. ðŸ˜† Let me share some of this fancy operators list with you.


|Operator                      |Example|Equivalent To|
|------------------------------|-------|-------------|
|+= (addition assignment)      |a += b |a = a + b    |
|-= (subtraction assignment)   |a -= b |a = a â€“ b    |
|*= (multiplication assignment)|a *= b |a = a * b    |
|/= (division assignment)      |a /= b |a = a / b    |
|%= (remainder assignment)     |a %= b |a = a % b    |


Letâ€™s wrap this operator with our cup of tea. Because you need coffee to understand the next operator.

* * *

3\. Rust Comparison Operators
-----------------------------

The heading says everything. Explanation is not required here.

This is called **>** (greater than). This operator is only required when you have to compare something. After comparison, the Output will be either **true** or **false**. You can this operator as a **relational operator**.

*   **TRUE** : If Condition Satisfied.
*   **FALSE** : If Condition Not Satisfied.

Letâ€™s list out some of the comparison operators


|Operator                     |Example|Description                            |
|-----------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|
|> (Greater than)             |a > b  |true if a is greater than b            |
|< (Less than)                |a < b  |true if a is less than b               |
|>= (Greater than or equal to)|a >= b |true if a is greater than or equal to b|
|<= (Less than or equal to)   |a <= b |true if a is less than or equal to b   |
|== (Equal to)                |a == b |true if a is equal to b                |
|!= (Not equal to)            |a != b |true if a is not equal to b            |


Oh, We forgot the example of comparison operators. Let me share ðŸ˜…

### Rust Comparison Operators Example

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = 7;
    let b = 3;
    
    // use of comparison operators
    let c = a > b;
    let d = a < b;
    let e = a == b;
    
    println!("{} >= {} is {}", a, b, c);
    println!("{} <= {} is {}", a, b, d);
    println!("{} == {} is {}", a, b, e);
}
```


#### Output:

```rs
7 > 3 is true
7 < 3 is false
7 == 3 is false
```

As we know if the condition is satisfied then **TRUE**, Otherwise **FALSE**. Thatâ€™s all about comparison operators. Actually, I donâ€™t know much about this operator because I donâ€™t like it. Simple ðŸ« ðŸ« 

I think we have to conclude with our last operator. The logic killer operator. Itâ€™s called **Logical Operator**.

* * *

4\. Rust Logical Operators
--------------------------

Find a second coffee, Because this operator required energy to understand. As you know words say everything. But the tricky part is, Itâ€™s not about logical things. Itâ€™s all about logical plus comparison. Let me show you how this works.

**Itâ€™s like comparing two logic.** **&&** This is an AND operator. AND Operator returns **TRUE** If both conditions are satisfied.

I know only three logical conditions ðŸ˜…, Let me share them one by one quickly via table

* Operator: && (Logical AND)
  * Example: exp1 && exp2
  * Description: returns true if both exp1 and exp2 are true
* Operator: || (Logical OR)
  * Example: exp1 || exp2
  * Description: returns true if any one of the expressions is true
* Operator: ! (Logical NOT)
  * Example: !exp
  * Description: returns true if the expression is false and returns false, if it is true


### Rust Logical Operators Example

```rs
fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b = false;
    
    // logical AND operation
    let c = a && b;

    // logical OR operation
    let d = a || b;

    // logical NOT operation
    let e = !a;
    
    println!("{} && {} = {}", a, b, c);
    println!("{} || {} = {}", a, b, d);
    println!("!{} = {}", a, e);
}
```


#### Output:

```rs
true && false = false
true || false = true
!true = false
```


Basically, **&&** Operater Works If both condition is **TRUE**, **||** Operartor works if one or more condition is **TRUE** and **!** Operartor used for when we donâ€™t want to satisify condition forcefully.

**Thatâ€™s It!!** ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ

**Today we show four pillars of Operators.**

*   Arithmetic Operators
*   Compound Assignment Operators
*   Logical Operators
*   Comparison Operators (Relational Operators)

**We show the each of the operators examples with 2 cup of Coffee and 1 Cup of Tea.** Why i am telling you because reading is easy but make content more readble and understandable is little difficult.ðŸ¥² Insted of sharing my childhood troma letâ€™s wrap up now!!. We will see **Rust conditions** in upcomming articles.
